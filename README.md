# Code-ash DApp

This repository serves as a foundation for building JavaScript-based Cartesi DApps. It leverages Node.js to run the backend logic. The main application begins execution from the src/index.js file. While the project currently uses esbuild for bundling, you can swap it out for any other bundler of your choice.
